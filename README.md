# Assignment 2

 ### **The Original Code** 

How to run the code and explanation: 	

Programmed using Phycharm application - Python 2.7	
 File name is: hashesOriginal.py 		
 
 This could be run using an IDE like pyCharm by running the file on pycharm ide. Include the command (written below) the same way you would on a terminal, on the IDE's terminal to run the code. 	
 
 It could also be run using the Terminal using the following command: **python hashesOriginal.py "the hash value"**		
 Part A command: python hashesOriginal.py b7a875fc1ea228b9061041b7cec4bd3c52ab3ce3 	
 
 Part B command: python hashesOriginal.py 801cdea58224c921c21fd2b183ff28ffa910ce31		
 
 Part C command: python hashesOriginal.py ece4bb07f2580ed8b39aa52b7f7f918e43033ea1	
 
Part D:  This program has the code for Part D written down but takes alot of time for it to reach a result.

 ### **The Original Code**	
 
 This code is written in a more optimized manner. I deducted the use of many for loops and took away the use of Lists. This enhanced my code slightly. Especially for part c.
